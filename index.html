<p>I'm a freshman at Drexel University pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science. My main area of interest is distributed systems, specifically consensus/consistency stuff, architecture, and databases.</p>

<p>I spent a good chunk of my time in highschool doing robotics. Read a lot of C and Java, wrote a lot of C and Java. Became head of programming and controls my junior year and ended up winning the FRC world championship that year. However the long hours on top of school work burned me out, so I decided to leave the team at the end of my junior year.</p>

<a id="larson-automation" class="anchor" href="#larson-automation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Larson Automation</h3>

<p>I ended up interning an older hardware company called Larson Automation during my 2014 summer. We built in circuit testing fixtures, which are used to automatically test circuit boards. I worked on embedded C to run those fixtures, wrote a bit of firmware, and rewrote an old C++ test log analysis tool in Clojure.</p>

<a id="ironio" class="anchor" href="#ironio" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>iron.io</h3>

<p>I spent the summer working on the internals of a distributed message queue, automatic code generation, and lockless datastructures at a fantastic SaaS company called iron.io</p>
